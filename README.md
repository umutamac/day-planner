# UT Austin Coding Bootcamp - 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This project is aimed at building a day planner that uses Moment.js library to use time and date related elements. 

The current date is displayed through moment() function.

The hour blocks that are in the past have a gray background and the future ones have green backgrounds. The current hour is red. The color decision is based on comparison between the current hour from moment() and assigned value of the hour block.

The hour blocks have textarea elements that user can write into, then click on the blue button aside to save what is typed in and still have it displayed in the box. The text input is stored in local storage on client side.
