# Work Day Planner
## Description

This app lets users type in information, to-dos, or any other text that could help them be more organized. There are hour slots from 8am to 5pm in which users can type into. Once the user click save next to each block, the text inside of the corresponding block is saved into local storage on client side, and thus persisted over reloads.

The hour slots have backgrounds that are assigned at the time of initial load of the app. The background of the slots can be gray for past hours, red for current hour, or green for future hours. Additionally, the current date is dsiplayed at the top of the page.

The app does not have a really developed styling, as it was aimed more towards functionality in two main areas: local storage and leveraging date/time information.

## Technologies and Tools
This project leverages jQuery for a simple and not cluttery coding experience. Additionally, the Moment.js library is being used to use date and time information for the dynamic hour slot background.
